    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a student in Class 1, Grade 12 at Red Star High School, we took part in a tree-planting mission on April 12th in response to the national call for greening our homeland. Our initiative aimed to contribute to environmental sustainability and have a positive impact on the surroundings.</p><p>Upon reaching school, we convened for a quick assembly where Mr. Cat, our teacher, outlined the essential tasks. Afterward, we moved to a suburban area chosen for our tree-planting activity. Our teacher invited forestry experts to share insights into sapling types and proper planting techniques. Divided into groups, we actively engaged in the hands-on experience of planting trees.<br>Equipped with shovels and saplings, our groups faced the challenge of digging proper holes in the soil. It was harder than expected, especially with the presence of rocks and the hard ground. We quickly realized the importance of teamwork, as we assisted each other in overcoming these obstacles.<br>It proved to be another challenge to place the saplings in the holes exactly. Ensuring the right depth and securing them in the soil required precision. Some of us initially struggled to position the saplings correctly, but with guidance from the experts and collaboration within our groups, we soon got the hang of it.<br>Despite the challenges, the hands-on nature of the activity taught us valuable lessons. We learned the significance of adaptability and problem-solving. The experience also fostered a sense of shared responsibility and collaboration among us, as we worked together to overcome difficulties encountered during the tree-planting process. </p><p>The activity finished for just a little time, but we were all happy. Documenting our progress with photographs and videos, we captured not only the challenges we faced but also the successful moments. It gave us both the joy of success and also the importance of teamwork in achieving a common goal. I think I will never forget it.</p>]]></content>

    <title>The Positive Trend of Online Shopping</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://img-qn.51miz.com/preview/photo/00/01/54/60/P-1546070-656A09B1.jpg" alt="Online Shopping"></p><p>In recent years, the proliferation of online shopping has sparked debates about its positive and negative impacts. I believe the ascent of online shopping is a positive trend, offering convenience, cost-effectiveness, and potential environmental sustainability.</p><p>First and foremost, the paramount advantage of online shopping is its unparalleled convenience. One can effortlessly browse, shop, and have goods delivered directly to their doorstep, a valuable resource for individuals with hectic schedules. For instance, a working professional can conveniently make purchases after work without the need to visit physical stores.</p><p>Secondly, cost-effectiveness is another crucial aspect. Online retailers, with lower operational costs, can provide competitive prices and frequent discounts. For example, major online shopping platforms frequently host promotional events, offering various discounts to consumers.</p><p>Despite the positive changes brought about by the rise of online shopping, it is important to note that there are now corresponding protective measures in place. Taking data security as an example, the 2017 Equifax data breach incident highlighted the vulnerability of sensitive information during online transactions. In this cyber-attack, 143 million U.S. citizens had their social security numbers and credit card details stolen, emphasizing the need for enhanced data security measures to safeguard consumers’ privacy and financial information. Of course, with the current protective measures in place, producers can further strengthen defenses against intruders. After doing so, I believe online shopping is the optimal way to make purchases.</p><p>In conclusion, while the prevalence of online shopping brings about convenience and economic benefits, it also necessitates addressing potential challenges such as data security and its impact on local businesses. By implementing appropriate regulations and measures, we can ensure that online shopping continues to offer a positive experience for consumers while mitigating potential risks.</p>]]></content>

    <title>Argument About History</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://img0.baidu.com/it/u=1069554551,580924521&fm=253&app=138&size=w931&n=0&f=JPEG&fmt=auto?sec=1706202000&t=1a72a6d4795fcbb1cf92b1587fff7ec1" alt="History"></p><p>Some people think it is important for all children to learn history in school. Others believe that other subjects are more relevant to children’s lives today. But in my opinion, making history a “mandatory” subject is very important.</p><p>Supporters of teaching history argue that it provides crucial insights into the development of societies and cultures. By understanding history, people can avoid making the same mistakes and draw inspiration from the processes of historical events to create new rules. For instance, learning about the Renaissance allows students to appreciate the profound impact of art and ideas on the shaping of European civilization. Understanding historical events, like the women’s suffrage movement, not only reveals the roots of gender equality struggles but also encourages critical thinking about contemporary issues. Moreover, history connects individuals to their heritage; studying ancient civilizations like the Egyptians or Greeks offers a tangible link to cultural roots. For example, exploring the history of the Silk Road provides a deeper understanding of cultural exchanges that continue to influence global perspectives. In addition, history fosters national pride by examining pivotal moments, such as independence movements, that shape a collective identity. For instance, studying the American Revolution instills a sense of pride in the country’s founding principles. In essence, history, through specific examples, enriches education by offering a comprehensive understanding of the past and its relevance to the present.</p><p>Opponents argue that in today’s rapidly changing world, subjects like Chinese, Mathematics, English, and Science are immediately relevant to children’s lives, emphasizing the need for practical skills in real-life situations. They contend that the contemporary landscape, marked by fast-paced dynamism, demands a focused approach on subjects with direct applicability to prepare the younger generation for evolving challenges in both the job market and society. Critics assert that proficiency in these subjects aligns with the demands of a competitive, technologically advanced world, providing essential skills for success in various professional fields. Emphasizing practical benefits beyond the classroom, they stress the importance of mastering these foundational subjects, considering them crucial for problem-solving, effective communication, and understanding technological advancements shaping the modern world. In essence, opponents advocate for a curriculum that prioritizes subjects with immediate applicability, emphasizing practical skills essential for success in the dynamic landscape of education and employment.</p><p>In my opinion, a balanced approach is crucial. While acknowledging the importance of practical subjects, history provides a crucial understanding of our roots and helps develop critical thinking skills. A well-rounded education system should integrate various disciplines, allowing students to appreciate the significance of historical knowledge alongside acquiring skills pertinent to the present and future.</p>]]></content>

    <title>A popular Chinese traditional food——Zongzi</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://img0.baidu.com/it/u=734678289,3305521186&fm=253&fmt=auto&app=138&f=JPEG?w=500&h=375" alt="粽子"><br>In our country, we have a lot of delicious traditional dishes. One of them is known as “zongzi”. We all like eating it very much.<br>First of all, let’s talk about how the zongzi is made. To make it, we need to prepare some reed leaves, glutinous rice, and other fillings. First, the glutinous rice should be soaked one night in advance before we wrap the zongzi. After the soaked glutinous rice is dried, we need to add an appropriate amount of red beans to the glutinous rice, stir it evenly, and then add some soy sauce, oyster sauce, and stir it evenly again. In this way, the zongzi will be more fragrant. Then, we should put the reed leaves into boiling water and boil them for about two minutes in order to make the leaves become soft and wrap the zongzi more easily. After all of that, you can start wrapping the zongzi. First, fold the reed leaves into a funnel shape. Then, add some fillings to the “funnel” and press it down tightly. At last, close the leaves and tie it up with beautiful threads. You can put it into the cold water and boil it. After all of that, you can only wait for a long time. I believe it will be delicious.<br>Some people might ask that when we eat it. We eat it for a poet named Qu Yuan. The poet Qu Yuan had an immense love to his country. As the reason, he helped the king of Chu administer the country so that the country would be more strong. But after a few years, another country named Qin attacked his country and occupied his country. Qu Yuan was very sorrowful. So, on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, Qu Yuan threw himself into the Miluo River, and died for his country. The people didn’t want the fish eat Qu Yuan. They threw the bamboo tube with rice into the river. After a long time, we always eat the zongzi on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month.<br>The zongzi is very important in my home country. We eat it for commemorating Qu Yuan. We will never forget him. The food is not only delicious but also memorable. We like it very much forever.</p>]]></content>
